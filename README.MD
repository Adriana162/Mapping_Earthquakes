# Mapping Earthquakes

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create interactive maps using GeoJSON data. The maps visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.
Javascript, the D3.js and Leaflet library are used to traverse and retrieve the earthquake data. Then the data is plot on a Mapbox map through an
API request.

The magnitude and location of the earthquakes are shown in a popup marker. The diameter of the markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake, plus their
size and color. The map has three layers of data, they are earthquakes, tectonic plates, and major earthquakes.
